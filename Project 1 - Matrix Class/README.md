# Overview

This project is an implementation of a matrix class in python that includes basic matrices operations such as:

- Inverse.
- Transpose.
- Trace
- Determinant 

and also some operators overloading such as subtraction, addition and multiplication.

# Usage 
While working with matrices it is possible to use this class and create an object.
The [kalman_filter_demo.py](https://github.com/HossamKhalil-hub01/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars-ND/blob/master/Project%201%20-%20Matrix%20Class/kalman_filter_demo.py) 
file utilized the matrix class as a demo, so you can check it out.

# Dependencies

Python 3

# Limitations

**Please Note That** :

The class can only compute the inverse and  determinant of maximum matrix size of (2x2) for now!
