# Udacity - Intro to Self-Driving Cars
---

This repository contains the **source code** of my implementations for all the projects in the [Udacity's Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-self-driving-cars--nd113) program


## Project
---

There are a total of 4 main projects and a couple of optional once you will find the main projects numbered while the optionals are not.



## Main Projects

### Project 1 - Matrix Class

A python matrix class that can perform basic matrices operations such as : multiplycation, addition, inverse,transpose,..etc.


### Project 2 - Histogram Filter in C++

Implementing a 2D histogram filter that can perform the prediction and measurement steps in C++.



### Project 3 - Route Planner

A Route Planner implementation based on A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.



### Project 4 - Traffic Light Classifier

Builing a complete simple traffic light classification pipeline (Pre-processing , Feature Extraction , Classification and Evaluation) that can obtain an accuracy up to **99%**  




## Optional Projects

### Histogram Filter on Python

Implementing a 2D histogram filter that can perform the prediction and measurement steps in Python.


### Histogram Code optimization in C++

Optimize the Histogram code to be more efficient and much faster to execute.


### Reconstructing Trajectories from Sensor Data

Track a motion of a vehicle / robot through acceleration , yaw rate and displacement data.
