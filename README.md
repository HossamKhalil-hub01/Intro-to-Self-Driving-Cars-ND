This repository contains the **source code** of my implementations for all the projects in the [Udacity's Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-self-driving-cars--nd113) program


## Projects

There are a total of 4 main projects and a couple of optional once you will find the main projects numbered while the optionals are not.

### Main Projects


* **[Project 1 - Matrix Class](https://github.com/HossamKhalil-hub01/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars-ND/tree/master/Project%201%20-%20Matrix%20Class)**:

  A python matrix class that can perform basic matrices operations such as : multiplycation, addition, inverse,transpose,..etc.


* **[Project 2 - Histogram Filter in C++](https://github.com/HossamKhalil-hub01/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars-ND/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20Histogram%20Filter%20in%20C%2B%2B)**:

  Implementing a 2D histogram filter that can perform the prediction and measurement steps in C++.



* **[Project 3 - Route Planner](https://github.com/HossamKhalil-hub01/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars-ND/tree/master/Project%203%20-%20Route%20Planner)**:

  A Route Planner implementation based on A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.


* **[Project 4 - Traffic Light Classifier](https://github.com/HossamKhalil-hub01/Intro-to-Self-Driving-Cars-ND/tree/master/Project%204%20-%20Traffic%20Light%20Classifier)**:

  Builing a complete simple traffic light classification pipeline (Pre-processing , Feature Extraction , Classification and Evaluation)   that can obtain an accuracy up to **99%**.
