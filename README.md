This repository contains the **source code** of my implementations for all the projects in the [Udacity's Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-self-driving-cars--nd113) program


## Projects

There are a total of 4 main projects and a couple of optional once you will find the main projects numbered while the optionals are not.

---
### Main Projects


* **Project 1 - Matrix Class**:

  A python matrix class that can perform basic matrices operations such as : multiplycation, addition, inverse,transpose,..etc.


* **Project 2 - Histogram Filter in C++**:

  Implementing a 2D histogram filter that can perform the prediction and measurement steps in C++.



* **Project 3 - Route Planner**:

  A Route Planner implementation based on A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.


* **Project 4 - Traffic Light Classifier**:

  Builing a complete simple traffic light classification pipeline (Pre-processing , Feature Extraction , Classification and Evaluation)   that can obtain an accuracy up to **99%**.

### Optional Projects


* **Histogram Filter on Python**:

  Implementing a 2D histogram filter that can perform the prediction and measurement steps in Python.


* **Histogram Code optimization in C++**:

  Optimize the Histogram code to be more efficient and much faster to execute.


* **Reconstructing Trajectories from Sensor Data**:

  Track a motion of a vehicle / robot through acceleration , yaw rate and displacement data.
